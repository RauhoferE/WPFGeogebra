# WPFGeogebra

## Description

This was an old university project.
The goal of this project was to create an app that is capable of drawing math functions.
The app also supports changing the color of these drawn functions as well as the changing the options of the grid where they are drawn.

Upon closing the app it will save the existing input in a file.
When opening the app again the last saved input will be restored.
